Rukbi Keyboard Layouts
======================

https://ilyabirman.ru/typography-layout/

Rukbi keyboard layouts enable a user to type various useful characters like quotation marks, en and em dashes, arrows,
as well as to use one combined layout for a pair of languages (Russian and Ukrainian, English and German).

To type additional characters, `AltGr` (right `Alt`) is used: thus, pressing `AltGr` + `<` will result in a quotation
mark: `Â«`.
